"""WakeWordEngine — sliding-window wake-word detector for the kiosk.

Architecture (PLAN-0008 §3 — three threads, one writer to st.session_state):

  audio thread (sounddevice callback)
        │   each 80 ms: int16[1280] frame
        ▼
   queue.Queue(maxsize=100, drop-oldest)
        │
  worker thread (this engine, daemon)
        │   model.predict(frame) → {model_name: float}
        │   if score >= threshold: write to lock-protected member
        ▼
  threading.Event (._detected_event)
        │
  main Streamlit thread
        │   reads via engine.poll_detection() each rerun
        │   (driven by streamlit-autorefresh @ 500 ms while running)
        ▼
  st.session_state update + visible UI banner

The engine NEVER touches `st.session_state` itself. All cross-thread
state lives in member fields guarded by `self._lock`; the main thread
reads via `poll_detection()` and is the only writer to session_state.

Idempotent `start()` so a Streamlit rerun that hits the start path
twice doesn't spawn duplicate streams or workers.

Engine ports verbatim to Reachy Mini in Task 4: swap the
`AudioSource` instance. Engine code stays.
