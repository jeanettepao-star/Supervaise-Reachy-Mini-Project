"""
Build a curated topic map for the CJ Panganiban corpus.

Reads the 79 generated .json files under corpus/{columns,speeches,biography}/
and writes:
  - corpus/voice/topic_map.json   — taxonomy + per-topic stats
  - reports/topic_map_report.json — coverage / unmatched-docs report

The taxonomy is a hand-curated dict of ~35 topics with matcher rules
(case-insensitive substring matches against title, primary_topics,
sub_topics, keywords, and entity names). Each topic carries a default
register and wit calibration from PROJECT.md §9.

Each document is scored against every topic; the top scorers become the
doc's primary topic_paths, the next tier become secondary. The same
matcher data is used by `apply_topic_paths.py` to backfill the per-doc
.json files.
