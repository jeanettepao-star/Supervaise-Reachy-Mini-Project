"""
config.py — single source of truth for every tunable knob in the
CJ Panganiban pilot.

Design contract (W1.1 / W3.3):
  * ONE file holds every knob. Code reads from here; it never hard-codes a
    literal that belongs in a sweep. W3.3 sweeps *this file* (or the matching
    env var) and never edits the code.
  * Every knob is overridable at runtime via an environment variable (and
    therefore via a `.env` file or a CLI `--set KEY=VALUE` wrapper) so a sweep
    can vary values WITHOUT editing code. Precedence: env var > default here.
  * Importing this module has no side effects beyond reading the environment —
    no network, no file I/O, no model loads. `import config` is always cheap.
  * One-line comment per knob states the trade-off it controls
    (cost / latency / recall / fidelity).

ARCHITECTURE NOTE — two generations of knob live here on purpose:
  [BASELINE]  knobs consumed by the *current* pipeline that ships today:
              Haiku router/gate → curated 35-topic map → Sonnet composer →
              Haiku fidelity check. No embeddings, no numpy retrieval, no RRF.
  [NEW-ARCH]  knobs for the LOCKED target architecture (dimensional/centroid
              topic model, in-memory numpy retrieval, RRF hybrid fusion,
              soft-prior topic bias). These are NOT yet wired into runtime code
              — they exist so W1.4–W1.7 can switch the engine on by reading
              config, not by re-plumbing literals. They are inert until then.

Usage:
    import config
    config.COMPOSER_MODEL_ID          # any knob, directly
    config.summary()                  # dict snapshot for logging / sweep manifests
