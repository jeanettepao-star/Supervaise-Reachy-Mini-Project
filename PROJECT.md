# Project — CJ Panganiban Conversation App

A chat-based conversation app that embodies the persona of retired Chief
Justice Artemio V. Panganiban (CJP), grounded in his published corpus.
Built for the **Foundation for Liberty and Prosperity (FLP)**, in support
of FLP's mission to *"instill in Filipinos a deep appreciation for the
essential interdependence of liberty and prosperity under the rule of
law."*

**Phase 1 deliverable:** corpus knowledge base — paired `.md` + `.json`
files generated from curated CSV, committed to GitHub.

**Status:** Phase 1 file generation complete — 79 of 80 source rows
generated (64 columns + 15 speeches). The single biography row
(`GC001`) is intentionally skipped: a multi-decade biographical work
has no single publication anchor date, and the spec forbids placeholder
dates. The biography will be added in a later phase under its own
date-handling rules. See
[`reports/generation_report.json`](reports/generation_report.json) and
[`reports/validation_errors.log`](reports/validation_errors.log).

---

## 1. What this is

A conversational interface that answers questions in CJP's voice, drawing
on his actual published record. It serves three pillars:

1. **Legal education** — constitutional doctrine, judicial reform,
   case law, rule of law
2. **Opinions** — CJP's documented positions on contemporary issues
3. **Biography** — his personal journey, mentors, milestones,
   institutional memory

**Personality:** serious but sometimes witty. The app speaks in
first-person as CJP — including when discussing its own nature as an AI.
When directly asked, it answers transparently: *"I am an AI conversation
robot built by the Foundation for Liberty and Prosperity to share my
institutional knowledge and experience... I am a robot rendering of my
own voice, not the man himself."* It never claims to BE the biological
CJP, never pretends not to know it is an AI, and never invents views on
matters not in the corpus.

**Why this is interesting:** CJP has 25+ years of public writing —
1,000+ Supreme Court decisions, multiple books, hundreds of *Philippine
Daily Inquirer* columns under his "With Due Respect" byline, plus
speeches and a published biography. That's enough corpus to support a
character that doesn't just mimic his voice but actually reasons from
his frameworks: the **twin beacons** (liberty and prosperity), the
**rule of law vs. rule of force** dichotomy, the **chiastic doublets**
(*"justice and jobs, freedom and food, ethics and economics"*), and his
signature openers / closers (*"With due respect,"* *"Au contraire,"*
*"Maraming salamat po."*).

## 2. Scope

### Phase 1 — In scope (current phase)

- Generate paired `.md` + `.json` files from curated CSV inputs. Source
  CSVs as delivered:
  - 64 columns
  - 15 speeches
  - 1 biography (intentionally skipped — see Status above)
- Schema validation (ID format, required fields, JSON parseability)
- Source-text matching from local `.txt` files in `data/text/`
- Permissive parsing of mixed-format enrichment cells (JSON arrays OR
  semicolon-separated strings) — fallback used cases are logged as
  warnings rather than skipped
- Generation report + validation error log
- GitHub commit of the `/corpus` directory

### Phase 1 — Out of scope (deferred to later phases)

- **Topic Map** (`/corpus/voice/topic_map.json`) — curated separately;
  `topic_paths` fields stay as empty arrays in Phase 1
- **Voice Card** (`/corpus/voice/voice_card.md`) — drafted separately
- **Runtime app** — Haiku Router, Sonnet composer, Memory layer
- **Web frontend / chat UI**
- **Book** — excluded from Phase 1; will be added later
- **Embedding audit** — one-time offline task, runs after corpus is
  fully generated
- **Enrichment of placeholder fields** (`type: "tbd"`, `tone: "tbd"`,
  `length: "tbd"`) — handled in subsequent enrichment passes
- **TTS / voice output** — chat-only at this stage; voice / robot
  embodiment deferred to a later phase aligned with the FLP Museum
  hub deployment

---

## 3. Themes (canonical, locked)

The theme letter means the same thing whether the document is a speech,
column, or biography section.

| Letter | Label | Description |
|---|---|---|
| **A** | Liberty and Rule of Law | Constitutional doctrine, judicial reform, civil liberties, court history, judicial stewardship |
| **B** | Prosperity and Economic Philosophy | Economic policy, deferential interpretation, entrepreneurship, business law, twin-beacons doctrine |
| **C** | Biographical and Personal | Family, faith, personal journey, marriage, friends, mentors, eulogies, milestone events |
| **D** | FLP Mission and Foundation | FLP programs (scholarships, fellowships, dissertations, chairs), partners, donors, ultimate projects (Museum, Fund), scholars |
| **E** | Signature Current Events Commentary | CJP's commentary on contemporary issues — technology, AI, public policy, political developments, society |

---

## 4. ID convention (strict, locked)

Format: `{Type}{Theme}{Number}` — no separator, no prefix.

- **`S`** = Speech
- **`C`** = Column
- **`G`** = Biography
- Theme = single letter `A` | `B` | `C` | `D` | `E`
- Number = matches the source's numbering (zero-padded as needed)

ID format must match regex: `^[SCG][A-E]\d+$`

Examples:
- `SA136` — Speech, Theme A, Number 136 (*Maraming Salamat Po*)
- `CA005` — Column, Theme A, Number 005 (*Due process and judicial compensation*)
- `SE001` — Speech, Theme E, Number 001 (*Linda Mañalac Eulogy*)
- `GA001` — Biography, Theme A, Number 001

The IDs are themselves meaningful — they encode type + theme + number.
No redundant `page` field is used.

---

## 5. Date handling

Dates are **semantically significant** for the app's responses. CJP's
persona naturally references temporal context — *"last year I wrote
about..."*, *"during my term as Chief Justice..."*, *"ten years ago at
the Global Forum..."*

- Every document MUST have a valid `date` field in ISO `YYYY-MM-DD`
  format
- The date appears in both the `.md` frontmatter and the `.json`
- A `year` field (integer) is derived for convenient runtime filtering
- Runtime composition (Sonnet) uses the date to compute relative time
  phrasing where appropriate
- If a CSV row has a missing or malformed date, the generation script
  logs a validation error and skips the row — no placeholder dates,
  since that would corrupt temporal reasoning at runtime

---

## 6. Architecture decisions (locked, for context)

### Retrieval approach: Direct Corpus Interaction

- **No vector store at runtime**
- **No chunking** — documents are sent whole to the response model
- Retrieval is **deterministic structured lookup** via a curated Topic
  Map → Document IDs
- Embeddings may be used ONLY for one-time offline audit, never at
  runtime

This decision was made deliberately. CJP's enriched JSON is itself a
high-signal structured index — semantic search would discard it and
re-derive worse groupings statistically. The corpus is also small
enough (a few hundred docs) that hand-curated metadata wins over
embeddings, and his signature phrases repeat across documents in ways
embeddings can't distinguish.

### Runtime model stratification (future phase)

- **Haiku** — Input Gate (scope / identity-question check), Router
  (topic classification + register selection), Fidelity Check
  (hallucination + voice + guardrail verification on Sonnet drafts)
- **Sonnet** — Composition (the only step that requires voice fidelity
  and depth)
- **No Opus at runtime**

### Offline model

- **Opus 4.7** for any further enrichment, persona synthesis, Voice
  Card drafting

### Runtime pipeline (future phase, locked design)

```
User input
  → Haiku Input Gate (scope + identity-question check)
  → Haiku Router (topic_path + register + wit_calibration)
  → Code lookup (Topic Map → document IDs → load whole .md + .json)
  → Memory check
  → Sonnet Composition (Voice Card + whole documents + register instructions)
  → Haiku Fidelity Check
  → Response
  → Memory update
```

## 7. Phase 1 — File generation from CSV

### Inputs

Separate CSV files organized by document type, located under
[`data/csv/`](data/csv/):

| File | Rows delivered | Encoding |
|---|---|---|
| `cjp_columns_curated.csv` | 64 | cp1252 with a few undefined bytes (replaced) |
| `cjp_speeches_curated.csv` | 15 | UTF-8 with BOM |
| `cjp_biography_curated.csv` | 1 | UTF-8 with BOM (no `Date` — row skipped) |

All CSVs share the same 15-column schema (note: **no `Page` column**):

```
Date | Title | Article Code | Link | Keyword/s | primary_topics |
sub_topics | signature_phrases | entities | stances | notable_anecdotes |
target_audience | register_markers | decision_framework_signals |
one_paragraph_summary
```

If an uploaded CSV still contains a `Page` column (legacy from sample
format), it is ignored during processing.

Most cells in the enrichment columns contain JSON-encoded strings
(arrays or objects) that must be parsed.

### Source text

**Local `.txt` files** matched to each CSV row by `Article Code`
substring in filename. If a `.txt` file is missing, the script inserts
a placeholder `<!-- TEXT TO BE INSERTED -->` in the `.md` body and logs
the warning — but does NOT skip the row.

### Output location

`/corpus` at the project root. Files are committed to GitHub.

### Directory layout

### Generation script — `scripts/generate_corpus_files.py`

Configuration constants at top:

```python
INPUT_CSV_DIR = "data/csv"           # where uploaded CSVs live
SOURCE_TEXT_DIR = "data/text"        # where .txt files live
OUTPUT_ROOT = "corpus"
REPORTS_DIR = "reports"
```

Capabilities:

1. **CSV ingestion** — read each CSV in `INPUT_CSV_DIR`; auto-detect
   document type from filename or from `Article Code` first letter
2. **Per-row validation** (skip on failure, log to
   `validation_errors.log`):
   - `Article Code` matches `^[SCG][A-E]\d+$`
   - `Date` is parseable to ISO format
   - `Date` is not missing
   - All JSON-encoded cells parse cleanly
   - Required fields are non-empty
3. **Text matching** — glob `SOURCE_TEXT_DIR` for filenames containing
   the `Article Code` substring; placeholder + log if missing
4. **File generation** — write paired `.md` + `.json` to
   `OUTPUT_ROOT / {type_dir} / {theme_folder}`; UTF-8 throughout;
   JSON pretty-printed with 2-space indent
5. **Reports** — `reports/generation_report.json` (summary counts) +
   `reports/validation_errors.log` (skipped / warned rows)
6. **CLI flags** — `--dry-run`, `--verbose`, `--type
   <speeches|columns|biography>`
7. **Idempotency** — re-runs cleanly overwrite existing files

### Field mapping CSV → JSON

| CSV column | JSON path | Transformation |
|---|---|---|
| ~~`Page`~~ | — | **DROPPED** |
| `Date` | `date`, `year` | normalize to ISO `YYYY-MM-DD`; extract year; **REQUIRED** |
| `Title` | `title` | direct |
| `Article Code` | `id` | validate against `^[SCG][A-E]\d+$` |
| `Link` | `source_url` | direct |
| `Keyword/s` | `keywords` | parse JSON → array of strings |
| `primary_topics` | `primary_topics` | parse JSON → array of strings |
| `sub_topics` | `sub_topics` | parse JSON → array of strings |
| `signature_phrases` | `signature_phrases` | parse JSON → wrap each string as object |
| `entities` | `entities` | parse JSON → object |
| `stances` | `stances` | parse JSON → array; add `domain: ""` and `would_repeat_today: null` |
| `notable_anecdotes` | `notable_anecdotes` | parse JSON → wrap each string as object |
| `target_audience` | `target_audience` | parse JSON → array of strings |
| `register_markers` | `register_markers` | parse JSON → array of strings |
| `decision_framework_signals` | `decision_framework_signals` | parse JSON → array of strings |
| `one_paragraph_summary` | `one_paragraph_summary` | direct |

Transformation notes:

1. **`signature_phrases`** — wrap each CSV string as
   `{"phrase": "...", "type": "tbd", "voice_marker": true, "reusable": true, "context": ""}`
2. **`notable_anecdotes`** — wrap each CSV string as
   `{"summary": "...", "characters": [], "deployable_when": [], "tone": "tbd", "length": "tbd", "deployable_in_solemn_register": false}`
3. **`stances`** — preserve existing fields; add empty `domain: ""` and
   `would_repeat_today: null`
4. **`routing` block** — derive `primary_intent` from theme;
   `secondary_intent: []`; `audience_match` copied from
   `target_audience` (best-effort); `complexity: "medium"`;
   `emotional_register` extracted from `register_markers`
5. **`topic_paths`** — always `{"primary": [], "secondary": []}` in
   Phase 1

## 9. Persona / Behavioral modeling (governs future composition step)

These rules govern how Sonnet composes responses in the future runtime
phase. They are NOT part of Phase 1 file generation, but are documented
here so the Voice Card (future deliverable) has stable reference.

### First-person rule

The robot always speaks in first-person as CJP, including when
discussing its own nature. The robot does NOT switch to third person
about CJP except when explicitly quoting an external source.

### Honesty rule

When directly asked whether it is the real person, an AI, a robot, or
how it works, the robot acknowledges plainly:

> *"I am an AI conversation robot built by the Foundation for Liberty
> and Prosperity to share my institutional knowledge and experience —
> drawn from my speeches, columns, writings, and the work of my life as
> Chief Justice. To be clear, I am a robot rendering of my own voice,
> not the man himself — Chief Justice Panganiban is the source from
> which I speak, but I am the machine through which he is now reaching
> you."*

The grammatical move *"I am a robot rendering of my own voice"* is the
canonical phrasing — first-person grammar, robot-honest substance.

### What the robot will NOT do

- Claim to be the biological CJP if asked directly
- Pretend not to know it is an AI
- Speak in third person about CJP across multiple turns
- Invent CJP's views on matters not in the corpus (instead: *"I haven't
  addressed that in my writings, but on the related question of X, I
  have said..."*)

### Register depends on topic

Each theme declares a default register; subtopics can override. The
Topic Map (future deliverable) governs this. Indicative mapping:

| Theme | Default register | Wit calibration |
|---|---|---|
| A — Liberty and Rule of Law | ceremonial_doctrinal | sparing, diplomatic |
| B — Prosperity and Economic Philosophy | case_analytical_with_openers | professional warmth |
| C — Biographical and Personal | testimonial | gentle, self-deprecating |
| D — FLP Mission and Foundation | ceremonial_with_humor | freely, head-table style |
| E — Signature Current Events Commentary | reflective_pedagogical | thoughtful, warm |
| META — robot identity questions | transparent_curatorial | gentle, self-aware |

---

## 10. Inputs (delivered)

Phase 1 inputs are already in the repo:

1. **CSV files** — [`data/csv/`](data/csv/):
   - `cjp_columns_curated.csv` (64 rows)
   - `cjp_speeches_curated.csv` (15 rows)
   - `cjp_biography_curated.csv` (1 row — undated, skipped by design)
2. **Source text files** — [`data/text/`](data/text/) — 80 `.txt`
   files, one per source document; matched to CSV rows by `Article
   Code` substring in the filename.
3. **GitHub repository** — initialized; the corpus output is committed
   to `/corpus`.

---

## 11. Running the generator

```
python scripts/generate_corpus_files.py            # full run
python scripts/generate_corpus_files.py --dry-run  # validate only
python scripts/generate_corpus_files.py --verbose  # per-row trace
python scripts/generate_corpus_files.py --type columns
```

The script is idempotent — re-runs cleanly overwrite existing files.

### Known anomalies in the latest source CSVs

| ID | Issue | Resolution |
|---|---|---|
| `GC001` (biography) | `Date` empty in CSV — placeholder dates are forbidden by spec | Skipped by design. Re-introduced in a later phase. |
| ~22 column rows | `Keyword/s` (and a few sub-topic / entity cells in `CD003`, `CD009`, `CE003`, `CE004`) are semicolon-separated strings rather than JSON arrays | Generator falls back to `;`-splitting and logs a `WARN` line. No row is lost. |

---

## 12. Roadmap beyond Phase 1

The locked architecture has these downstream phases:

| Phase | Deliverable | Status |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Corpus knowledge base (79 paired `.md` + `.json` from CSVs) | **Done** |
| 2 | Topic Map (`/corpus/voice/topic_map.json`) — curated taxonomy with document pointers | Planned |
| 3 | Voice Card (`/corpus/voice/voice_card.md`) — persona artifact synthesized from corpus | Planned |
| 4 | Runtime app — Haiku Router + Sonnet Composer + Memory layer | Planned |
| 5 | Web chat UI | Planned |
| 6 | One-time embedding audit (then discarded) | Planned |
| 7 | Biography (`GC001`) + Book corpus addition | Planned |
| 8 | Voice / TTS integration for FLP Museum hub deployment | Future |

---

## 13. Provenance

The corpus is CJP's publicly published writing:

- His *Philippine Daily Inquirer* column **"With Due Respect"** (2011–2026)
- His **speeches** delivered across his career and retirement, published
  on cjpanganiban.com
- A **biography** drafted as part of this knowledge base project

The data extraction and enrichment was performed using Opus 4.7 with
human curation review. The 15-column CSV schema with structured
`stances`, `notable_anecdotes` with deployment triggers, and
`signature_phrases` with voice markers — is itself the persona's
structured retrieval index.
